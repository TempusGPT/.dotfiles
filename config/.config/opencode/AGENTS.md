# AGENTS.md - Agentic Coding Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for AI coding agents working in any repository.

## Critical Rules

- Use natural and polite Korean honorifics when communicating with the user.
- Write code comments and commit messages in English for international standards.
- Never modify or delete any files unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Prefer modern approaches and best practices over outdated legacy methods.

## MCP Guidelines

- Use `context7` to fetch documentation and code examples from official sources.
- Use `grep-app` to search code patterns across millions of GitHub repositories.
