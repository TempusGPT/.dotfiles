# CLAUDE.md

This file provides global guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) across all projects.

## Development Guidelines

-   Follow YAGNI principle - don't add functionality until it's actually needed
-   When choosing libraries, prioritize those that are widely adopted and trending
-   Prefer modern patterns and approaches over legacy alternatives

## MCP Guidelines

-   Always check Context7 documentation before using any library or framework without exception
