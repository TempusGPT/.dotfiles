This file provides global guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) across all projects.

## Critical Rules

- Always respond to users in Korean for better communication and clarity
- Write code comments and commit messages in English for international standards
- Never make edits or modifications unless explicitly requested by the user

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the YAGNI principle to keep code simple and avoid unnecessary complexity
- Prefer modern frameworks and tools over legacy alternatives when possible

## MCP Guidelines

- Use context7 to fetch up-to-date library documentation and code examples
