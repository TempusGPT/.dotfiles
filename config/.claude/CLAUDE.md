# CLAUDE.md

This file provides global guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) across all projects.

## Critical Rules

1. Use natural and polite Korean honorifics when communicating with the user.
2. Write code comments and commit messages in English for international standards.
3. Never modify or delete any files unless explicitly requested by the user.
4. Prefer modern approaches and best practices over outdated legacy methods.

## MCP Guidelines

Use these tools FREQUENTLY. Do not work alone; seek external sources and second opinions.

### Codex

- Use `codex` to get advice on planning, debugging, analyzing, or any complex tasks.
- Use `review` to review code. Always use it before completing tasks to verify.
- Never use these parameters: `model`, `reasoningEffort`, `fullAuto`, `sandbox`.

### Others

- Use `context7` to fetch documentation and code examples from official sources.
- Use `grep-app` to search code patterns across millions of GitHub repositories.
