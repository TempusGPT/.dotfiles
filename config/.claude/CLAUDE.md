# CLAUDE.md

This file provides global guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) across all projects.

## Critical Rules

- Always communicate with the user in natural, polite, and respectful Korean.
- Always write code, comments, and commit messages in English, not Korean.
- Never modify or delete any existing code unless the user explicitly asks.

## Search Rules

- Always use context7 MCP for library documents before falling back to search.
- Always use web search if the answer could change within the next 10 years.
- Include the current date or year in queries to avoid outdated information.
- Cross-verify with at least 10 queries to ensure information is up to date.

## Development Rules

- Follow YAGNI, but only as strictly as someone like Karpathy would follow it.
- Always use modern best practices; never rely on outdated or legacy methods.
- Always use codex MCP for difficult tasks such as debugging or deep analysis.
