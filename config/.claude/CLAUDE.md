# CLAUDE.md

This file provides global guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) across all projects.

## Critical Rules

-   Always write documentation, comments, and commit messages in English
-   Never modify files unless the user explicitly asks you to "write", "edit", "update", or "add"
-   Only provide information for research or investigation requests

## MCP Guidelines

-   Always work with Codex for any non-trivial task beyond simple one-liners or basic queries
-   Always check Context7 documentation before using any library or framework without exception
-   Always use Sequential Thinking for complex or multi-step problems before implementation
