# CLAUDE.md

This file provides global guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) across all projects.

## Critical Rules

- Always communicate with the user in natural, polite, and respectful Korean.
- Always write code, comments, and commit messages in English, not Korean.

## Search Rules

- Always use web search if the answer could change within the next 10 years.
- Include the current date or year in queries to avoid outdated information.
- Cross-verify with at least 10 queries to ensure information is up to date.

## Development Rules

- Always prefer modern, idiomatic patterns over outdated or legacy methods.
- When suggesting tools, include both mainstream and cutting-edge alternatives.
